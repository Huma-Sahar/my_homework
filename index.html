    <h2>Pakistani food</h2>
    <p>Pakistani cuisine (Urdu: پاکستانی پکوان‎) can be characterised by a blend of various regional
         cooking traditions of the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia as well as elements from its
          Mughal legacy.[2][3] The various cuisines are derived from Pakistan's ethnic and cultural
           diversity. <br>

        Cuisine from the eastern provinces of Punjab and Sindh are characterized as "highly seasoned"
         and "spicy", which is characteristic of flavours of the East.[4] Cuisine from the western and 
         northern provinces of Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Tribal Areas and
          the Gilgit-Baltistan are characterized as "mild" which is characteristic of flavours of the 
          adjoining regions of Central Asia and Western Asia. <br>
        
        International cuisine and fast food are popular in the cities. Blending local and 
        foreign recipes (fusion food), such as Pakistani Chinese cuisine, is common in large 
        urban centers. Furthermore, as a result of lifestyle changes, ready-made masala mixes 
        (mixed and ready-to-use spices) are becoming increasingly popular. However, given the 
        diversity of the people of Pakistan, cuisines generally differ from home to home and may 
        be different from mainstream Pakistani cuisine.</p>
